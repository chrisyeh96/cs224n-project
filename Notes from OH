padding:
fixed length - pad and truncate (easy version)
separate buckets - up to length 10, 20, 30, ...
	feed in batch of specific length

inputs batch 1, inputs batch 2 in create feed dict

LSTM, conv, rnn
	pad on both sides (conv) - make sure padding is not a word in vocab
	lstm - pad on one side
	dynamic rnn - sequences and length of sequences (lstms)

no need to mask

loss:
	output 2 scores
	output 1 score and do sigmoid (CE loss)
