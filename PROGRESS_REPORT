Project: Detecting duplicate questions on a Quora dataset

Baseline
--------
So far, we have implemented a baseline algorithm which takes the words of each 
question and takes the average of their GloVe vector representations to come up
with a Bag-of-Words representation of the sentence.

We then compared potential duplicates using euclidian, manhattan, and cosine 
distances between these word vector averages and used a simple Linear Regression 
model to determine a cosine distance threshold for duplicate questions. We found
that cosine distance gave the best results.

We used an 80/20 training/testing split on our dataset, and this baseline model
resulted in ~63% accuracy.

Model Exploration
-----------------
We have begun to adapt some of the code framework provided to us in previous
assignments (classes, helper functions), and are in the process of setting up
and testing a basic RNN.
